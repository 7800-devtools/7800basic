 rem *** paddles are one of the controllers that are read during the visible
 rem *** screen, and will eat up CPU cycles. Reducing the range in half and
 rem *** scaling the paddle values x2 will cut CPU usage in half, at the
 rem *** loss of resolution.

 rem *** The paddle range. Increasing this will increase CPU usage during
 rem *** the visible screen.

 rem *** The driving control does 16 pulses per full rotation. To use the
 rem *** control like a paddle (instead of a slowly turned steering wheel)
 rem *** you'd need to turn the control 10 full rotations to cross the 
 rem *** screen. 
 rem *** To overcome this, when the driving control is selected (later)
 rem *** we use "port0resolution = 3" to triple the size of values returned. 
 rem *** We also apply a "drivingboost" acceleration curve (here) so the
 rem *** values returned are larger than 3, when the wheel is turned quickly,
 set drivingboost on

 rem *** Eliminate Y axis checking for mice. Uses less CPU time.
 set mousexonly on

 rem *** Our default is paddle. No particular reason.
